Please summarize the difference in your own words and indicate when you should use `for` loop and when you should use `while` loop. if you want to check the attendance of the students, what loop should you use?  Reading the following section will help you: Lecture 10 loops in the ebook on blackboard, or here https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/~machas/numerical-methods-for-engineers.pdf\n",

    "5. Can I write a new version of the code as shown below with less lines of code? Discuss the advantage and disadvantage of this approach, e.g., does it run faster? is it easy to understand the code compared with the original version? You can call these two functions 100 times and measure the code execution time   \n",
